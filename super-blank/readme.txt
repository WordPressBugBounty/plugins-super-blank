== Description ==

<h4>SUPER BLANK MAKES IT SUPER EASY TO BUILD YOUR WEBSITE</h4>

<p>With just one click it lets you install a beautiful, clean, and fully responsive blank layout.</p>

<p>This gives you the perfect starting point, and then you can use Elementor to build anything that you want from there.</p>

<p>No more choosing a theme, staring at a confusing screen, or fighting with complicated settings.</p>

<p>Super Blank makes website building super easy â€“ even if you've never built a website before.</p>

<p>Just follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click a button to import your blank design.</li>
	<li>Preview and choose your favorite colors that automatically apply to your whole site.</li>
